The App project is an automated testing framework developed using Appium with Java, designed for testing both iOS and Android applications. This project focuses on handling both native and hybrid apps, leveraging the Page Object Model (POM) to enhance code maintainability and readability.

Key features include:

- Cross-Platform Testing: Supports parallel execution of test cases on both iOS and Android platforms using Android Driver and XCUITest Driver, ensuring full coverage across different devices and environments.
- Page Object Model (POM): The use of POM ensures a clear separation of test scripts and the UI elements, making the codebase easier to manage and extend.
- TestNG Integration: TestNG is used for managing test suites, enabling the parallel execution of tests and providing detailed test reports.
- Hybrid App Handling: The framework is equipped to handle both native and hybrid app elements, ensuring flexibility in testing different types of mobile applications.
- TestNG XML Integration: Utilizes TestNG XML for managing and running test suites, allowing for parallel execution of tests and providing detailed test reports and logging.
